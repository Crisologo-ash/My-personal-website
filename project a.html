    <p>
        SDG 4, <mark>FOCUSED ON QUALITY EDUCATION</mark>, is vital for achieving other Sustainable Development Goals, 
        yet global progress remains insufficient. As of 2019, only 58% of primary students achieved minimum reading proficiency,
        and learning outcomes, especially in math and reading, have declined in many countries, even before COVID-19. 
        While primary and lower secondary completion rates are rising, upper secondary improvements have slowed,
        and disparities persist based on socioeconomic status, location, and gender. Early childhood development is 
        on track for two-thirds of children in low- and middle-income countries, and pre-primary participation is
        rebounding after pandemic-related declines. However, adult education participation is low, especially for those 
        over 25. Many schools lack essential infrastructure, particularly for students with disabilities and gender-specific 
        needs, though access to electricity and internet is improving. Accelerating action on SDG 4 is crucial to unlocking 
        progress across the broader 2030 Agenda.
